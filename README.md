# Part-fault-classifier

This project is about a machine learning model trained to Classify whether a particular part in an assembly line is faulty or not based on the data received from the sensor
This is a binary classification problem where the parts are classified as Faulty or not faulty.
An end to endd pipeline is created right from the starting of the data gathering step to final model deployment to cloud is done.
At every step activity is logged with error messages wherever necessary
